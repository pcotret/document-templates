Use this template as you wish. Feel free to modify it and/or distribute it. If you want to acknowledge, do not hesitate to put the website address http://olivier.commowick.org/thesis_template.php somewhere. Anyway, this is not mandatory.

This template is designed to be compiled with modern interfaces for writing Latex documents so that all compilation steps are made in the right order. I strongly suggest Sublime Text (https://www.sublimetext.com) with LatexTools (https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools) installed but other interfaces exist.

More details on what is included in this template/example is detailed very rapidly on the website. If you encounter any problem, please look at the help on the website or feel free to contact me.
