\section{Illustration Example}

\subsection{A subsection just for fun}

Sorry I won't write your PhD or HDR here. This small text just to mention that this style supports writing with accents such as in french words (thèse, définir, ...). Also I put here a simple way to include an image. This is standard latex. The base folder containing images is set in formatAndDefs.tex.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Chapitre1/arctic_control}
  \end{center}
  \caption{A nice image...}
  \label{fig:jolieImage}
\end{figure}

\section{An equation}

Just to show argmin and partial derivative commands.

\begin{equation}
  T = \argmin_T E(T,R,F)
\end{equation}

Regularization:

\begin{equation}
  \pd{T}{t} = \Delta T
\end{equation}

\section{An other section}

Showing a great bullet list environment:

\begin{bulletList}
 \item First point
 \item Second point
\item Here is an abbreviation \ac{DTI}, defined in the Acronyms.tex file
\end{bulletList}
